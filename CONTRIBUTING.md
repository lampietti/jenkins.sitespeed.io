# How to contribute
The sitespeed.io Jenkins plugin is quite new so please help us make it even better!

## Making changes
If you want help out, that's great! Check the issue list and see if there's something there you want to do and drop me a note so I know and I can help you get into the project.

## Add a defect
First, check the defect/bug list https://github.com/sitespeedio/jenkins.sitespeed.io/issues?labels=bug&page=1&state=open to make sure that it hasn't been filed yet.

If you find a defect, please file a bug report. Include the following:
 - Explain the bug/defect and what you where doing.
 - OS & versions (Windows is not supported, it may work, but I don't test it)
 - Add a screenshot and clearly point out where the defect is.
 - Add a log of the output and reference the error logs as a gist. 

If you have the skills & the time, it is perfect if you send a pull request with a fix, that helps me a lot!

## Add a change request/new functionality request
If you have an idea or something that you need the Jenkins plugin to handle, add an issue and lets discuss it there. Ideas/changes/requests are very very welcome!


Thanks for your time & support!
